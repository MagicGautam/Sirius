# ðŸ“¥ Trivy Scan Ingestion & Analysis Flow

This section outlines the full methodology for how Container Image findings are ingested, analyzed using a local LLM (via Ollama), and cached for efficient retrieval.

SIRIUS Container Scan Feature - Documentation Update
This document outlines the key changes and new functionality implemented today to enhance the container scanning feature. The primary focus was on improving the data ingestion logic and creating a new endpoint for more granular data retrieval.

Service Logic Improvements
The core of our work today involved refactoring the data ingestion process within the ContainerService. Previously, the ingestion logic directly stored vulnerability findings without creating a parent record for the entire scan, which led to a loss of valuable metadata.

We addressed this by restructuring the ingestion into a two-part process:

ingest_trivy_report: This is now the main entry point for ingesting a full Trivy report. It is responsible for creating a new ContainerScan record, which contains high-level information like the image name, timestamp, and a unique hash of the entire report. This hash ensures that duplicate reports are not processed multiple times. Once the parent scan record is created, this method then calls the second method to handle the individual findings.

ingest_container_finding: The original ingestion code was refactored into this new, more modular method. It is now responsible solely for parsing the vulnerabilities from the report and creating a ContainerFinding record for each one. Crucially, it now correctly links each finding back to its parent ContainerScan using the scan_id provided by the calling method.

This new architecture ensures data integrity, prevents redundant data, and establishes the correct one-to-many relationship between a scan and its findings.

API Endpoints for Container Scan
We have updated one existing endpoint and created a new one to support the new service logic.

1. Ingest Container Scan Report
Method: POST

URL: /api/container/scans

Description: This endpoint is used to submit a complete Trivy vulnerability report in JSON format. The service will process the report, create a new scan record, and store all associated findings. The endpoint will intelligently skip the ingestion process if the same report has already been submitted.

Success Response: A status message confirming the ingestion, including the number of new findings created and the total number of findings found in the report.

2. Retrieve Findings for a Specific Scan
Method: GET

URL: /api/container/scans/{scan_id}/findings

Description: This endpoint allows you to retrieve all vulnerability findings that belong to a single, specific container scan. The scan_id is a unique integer identifier for the scan record.

Success Response: A JSON array of all the vulnerability finding objects associated with the provided scan ID. An empty array will be returned if the scan exists but has no findings.

Error Response: Returns a 404 Not Found error if a scan with the specified scan_id does not exist in the database.
